- Linear Search → simple, works on unsorted arrays.
- Binary Search → efficient, requires sorted arrays.
- Jump Search → skips blocks, then linear search.
- Interpolation Search → estimates position, good for uniformly distributed data.
- Exponential Search → finds range quickly, then binary search.
- Ternary Search → splits into three parts, less common but interesting.

Searching Algorithms (time complexity in words)
- Linear Search: 
Best case is constant time O(1) if the element is at the beginning. 
Worst case is O(n) if the element is at the end or not present. 
Average case is also O(n).

- Binary Search: 
Best case is O(1) if the middle element is the target. 
Worst and average case are O(log n). 
Requires a sorted array.

- Jump Search: 
Best case is O(1). 
Average and worst case are about O(sqrt{n}). 
Works on sorted arrays.

- Interpolation Search: 
Best case is O(1). 
Average case is O(log log n) for uniformly distributed data. 
Worst case can degrade to O(n).

- Exponential Search: 
Best case is O(1). 
Average and worst case are O(log n). 
Useful for unbounded or infinite lists.

- Ternary Search: 
Best case is O(1). 
Average and worst case are O(log n). 
Splits the array into three parts instead of two.
